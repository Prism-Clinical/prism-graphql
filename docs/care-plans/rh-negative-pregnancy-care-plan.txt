[OVERVIEW]
Rh-negative pregnancy occurs in approximately 15% of Caucasian patients. Without
prophylaxis, an Rh-negative mother carrying an Rh-positive fetus can develop anti-D
antibodies that cause hemolytic disease of the fetus/newborn (HDFN) in current or
future pregnancies. RhIG (Rho(D) Immune Globulin) prophylaxis has reduced Rh
alloimmunization from 12-13% to less than 1%, making this a preventable condition.

[SYMPTOMS]
Rh-negative status itself has no symptoms. However, in alloimmunized pregnancies:
Maternal Signs:
- None specific (maternal antibodies do not affect mother)

Fetal/Neonatal Complications (if sensitized):
- Fetal anemia
- Hydrops fetalis (fluid accumulation)
- Neonatal hyperbilirubinemia
- Kernicterus
- Fetal or neonatal death (severe cases)

[DIAGNOSIS]
Initial Screening (All Patients):
- ABO and Rh blood typing at first prenatal visit
- Red blood cell antibody screen (indirect Coombs test)

Positive Screen Management:
- If antibody screen negative: proceed with prophylaxis pathway
- If antibody screen positive: patient is alloimmunized - do NOT give RhIG

Fetal Assessment (if sensitized):
- Paternal Rh testing if possible
- Cell-free fetal DNA for RHD genotype
- Middle cerebral artery Doppler surveillance
- Serial antibody titers until critical threshold

[TREATMENT]
UNSENSITIZED Rh-NEGATIVE PATIENT:

First Trimester (<12 weeks):
- ACOG 2024: Routine RhIG NOT required for losses/procedures < 12 weeks
- May give RhIG for ectopic pregnancy, molar pregnancy, or patient preference
- If given, 50 mcg (mini-dose) is sufficient

Second Trimester (12-27 weeks):
- RhIG 300 mcg required for:
  * Pregnancy loss >= 12 weeks
  * Threatened abortion with bleeding
  * Amniocentesis, CVS, cordocentesis
  * Abdominal trauma
  * Molar pregnancy evacuation
- Give within 72 hours of event; partial benefit up to 28 days

Third Trimester (28 weeks to delivery):
- ROUTINE: RhIG 300 mcg at 28 weeks (all unsensitized patients)
- Repeat antibody screen before 28-week dose
- Additional RhIG for: antepartum hemorrhage, external cephalic version, trauma
- If > 12 weeks since last RhIG and still pregnant, consider repeat dose

Postpartum:
- Test cord blood for infant Rh type and DAT
- If infant Rh-positive: RhIG 300 mcg within 72 hours
- Kleihauer-Betke if large FMH suspected (> 30 mL coverage per 300 mcg dose)
- If infant Rh-negative: no postpartum RhIG needed

ALLOIMMUNIZED PATIENT (Positive Antibody Screen):
- Do NOT give RhIG (ineffective once sensitized)
- Refer to Maternal-Fetal Medicine
- Quantitative anti-D titer monitoring
- If titer >= 1:16-1:32 or prior affected pregnancy: MCA Doppler surveillance
- May require intrauterine transfusion if severe fetal anemia
- Plan delivery at 37-38 weeks with NICU availability

[FOLLOW_UP]
- Repeat antibody screen at 28 weeks before routine RhIG
- Document all RhIG administrations
- Passive anti-D from RhIG may cause positive screen for 2-3 months
- Postpartum: reassess need for ongoing Rh care in future pregnancies
- Ensure intrapartum team aware of Rh status

[PATIENT_EDUCATION]
- Explain that RhIG prevents formation of harmful antibodies
- Emphasize importance of receiving RhIG at 28 weeks and after delivery
- Report any trauma, bleeding, or procedures immediately
- RhIG is a blood product - discuss if patient has religious concerns
- Future pregnancies will also require Rh screening and prophylaxis
- If already sensitized, close monitoring protects the baby
