[OVERVIEW]
Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) is extremely common in pregnancy, affecting
up to 80% of pregnant patients. Hormonal effects (progesterone-mediated LES relaxation)
and mechanical factors from the enlarging uterus contribute to symptoms. Diagnosis is
clinical based on heartburn and regurgitation. Routine endoscopy is not indicated
unless alarm symptoms are present.

[SYMPTOMS]
- Heartburn (burning chest sensation)
- Regurgitation of stomach contents
- Dyspepsia and bloating
- Nausea (may overlap with pregnancy-related nausea)
- Nocturnal symptoms and sleep disturbance
- Waterbrash (hypersalivation)

Alarm Symptoms Requiring Urgent Evaluation:
- GI bleeding (hematemesis, melena)
- Dysphagia or odynophagia
- Persistent vomiting beyond typical morning sickness
- Involuntary weight loss
- Chest pain not clearly reflux-related

[DIAGNOSIS]
- Clinical diagnosis based on typical symptoms
- No routine diagnostic testing for uncomplicated heartburn
- Endoscopy (EGD) indicated only for alarm symptoms or refractory cases
- If EGD needed, perform ideally in second trimester with appropriate precautions

[TREATMENT]
Stepwise approach prioritizing safety:

Step 1: Lifestyle and Dietary Modifications
- Small, frequent meals; avoid eating 3 hours before bed
- Avoid triggers: fatty/spicy foods, citrus, tomato, chocolate, caffeine, carbonated drinks
- Elevate head of bed 6-8 inches; left lateral sleeping position
- Avoid tight garments; limit excessive weight gain

Step 2: Antacids (OTC) - First-line medication
- Calcium carbonate (Tums) preferred - safe and provides calcium
- Avoid sodium bicarbonate and magnesium trisilicate

Step 3: Sucralfate - Add for persistent symptoms
- 1 gram BID-QID before meals
- Minimal absorption; 90% symptom relief in studies

Step 4: H2 Receptor Antagonists
- Famotidine 20 mg once or twice daily (Category B)
- Avoid ranitidine (withdrawn from market)

Step 5: Proton Pump Inhibitors - For refractory/severe symptoms
- Lansoprazole or pantoprazole preferred (Category B)
- Omeprazole acceptable if needed (extensive safety data)
- Use lowest effective dose

[FOLLOW_UP]
- Reassess every 2-4 weeks during active treatment
- Step down therapy when symptoms controlled
- Consider step-down postpartum as symptoms often improve
- 20% may continue to have GERD postpartum - transition to standard management

[PATIENT_EDUCATION]
- Medications discussed are considered low-risk in pregnancy
- Untreated severe GERD can adversely affect nutrition, sleep, and quality of life
- Most patients respond to conservative measures initially
- Full symptom control may require medication escalation
- Report any alarm symptoms immediately
