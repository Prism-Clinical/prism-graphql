[CLINICAL CONTENT]
--- OVERVIEW ---
Streptococcal pharyngitis (strep throat) is an acute bacterial infection of the
oropharynx caused by Group A Streptococcus (Streptococcus pyogenes). It accounts
for approximately 15-30% of pharyngitis cases in children aged 5-15 years and
5-15% of cases in adults. The condition is most common during late winter and
early spring months.

Accurate diagnosis is important because untreated or inadequately treated GAS
pharyngitis can lead to suppurative complications (peritonsillar abscess,
retropharyngeal abscess, cervical lymphadenitis, mastoiditis) and non-suppurative
sequelae (acute rheumatic fever, post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis).

Antibiotic therapy is recommended for confirmed GAS pharyngitis to reduce
symptom duration, prevent complications, reduce transmission, and most
importantly, prevent acute rheumatic fever.

--- SYMPTOMS ---
- Sudden onset of sore throat (odynophagia)
- Fever, often >38.3C (101F)
- Tonsillar erythema and exudates (white/yellow patches)
- Tender, enlarged anterior cervical lymph nodes
- Palatal petechiae (red spots on soft palate)
- Headache
- Abdominal pain (especially in children)
- Nausea or vomiting (more common in children)
- Scarlatiniform rash (sandpaper texture) in scarlet fever

Symptoms that suggest viral etiology rather than GAS:
- Cough
- Rhinorrhea (runny nose)
- Hoarseness
- Oral ulcers
- Viral exanthem
- Conjunctivitis
- Diarrhea

--- DIAGNOSIS ---
Clinical scoring systems (Centor/McIsaac) can help stratify probability but
microbiologic testing is required for diagnosis confirmation.

Modified Centor (McIsaac) Score:
- Tonsillar exudates: +1 point
- Tender anterior cervical adenopathy: +1 point
- Fever history (>38C): +1 point
- Absence of cough: +1 point
- Age 3-14 years: +1 point
- Age 15-44 years: 0 points
- Age 45+ years: -1 point

Interpretation:
- Score 0-1: No testing or antibiotics (risk <10%)
- Score 2-3: Perform RADT, treat if positive
- Score 4-5: Perform RADT, consider empiric treatment

Diagnostic Algorithm:
1. Calculate modified Centor score
2. If score >= 2: Perform RADT
3. If RADT positive: Diagnose GAS pharyngitis, initiate antibiotics
4. If RADT negative in children/adolescents: Perform backup throat culture
5. If RADT negative in adults (score 2-3): No further testing needed
6. Treat based on culture result if performed

--- TREATMENT ---
First-Line Therapy (No Penicillin Allergy):
- Penicillin V 500mg PO BID x 10 days (adults)
- Penicillin V 250mg PO BID-TID x 10 days (children <27kg)
- Amoxicillin 500mg PO BID x 10 days (adults) - better palatability
- Amoxicillin 50mg/kg PO once daily (max 1000mg) x 10 days (children)

Penicillin Allergy (Non-Anaphylactic):
- Cephalexin 500mg PO BID x 10 days
- Cefadroxil 500mg PO BID x 10 days

Penicillin Allergy (Anaphylactic/Severe):
- Azithromycin 500mg day 1, then 250mg days 2-5
- Clindamycin 300mg PO TID x 10 days

Note: Macrolide resistance in GAS is increasing (5-10% in US), so azithromycin
should be reserved for patients with true severe penicillin allergy.

--- COMPLICATIONS ---
Suppurative Complications (days to weeks after infection):
- Peritonsillar abscess (quinsy) - most common
- Retropharyngeal abscess
- Cervical lymphadenitis
- Mastoiditis
- Sinusitis
- Otitis media
- Meningitis (rare)

Non-Suppurative Complications (weeks after infection):
- Acute rheumatic fever (2-4 weeks post-infection)
  - Carditis, arthritis, chorea, erythema marginatum, subcutaneous nodules
  - Prevented by antibiotic treatment within 9 days of symptom onset
- Post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis (1-3 weeks post-infection)
  - Hematuria, edema, hypertension
  - NOT prevented by antibiotic treatment
- PANDAS (Pediatric Autoimmune Neuropsychiatric Disorders Associated with Strep)
  - Controversial; characterized by sudden onset OCD/tics

--- FOLLOW_UP ---
Routine follow-up is not necessary for uncomplicated strep pharyngitis with
appropriate antibiotic therapy and clinical response.

Indications for Follow-Up:
- Symptoms not improving after 48-72 hours of antibiotics
- Recurrence of symptoms within 2-4 weeks
- Development of new symptoms suggesting complications
- Multiple recurrences (>3 per year)

Test of Cure:
- Not routinely recommended
- Consider in patients with history of rheumatic fever
- Consider in outbreak settings

Recurrent Strep Pharyngitis:
- Ensure compliance with full antibiotic course
- Consider carrier state vs. re-infection
- Alternative antibiotic regimens for failures
- ENT referral for tonsillectomy consideration if frequent

--- PATIENT_EDUCATION ---
Key Teaching Points:
1. Complete all antibiotics even when feeling better
2. Discard toothbrush after 24 hours of antibiotics
3. Stay home from work/school until on antibiotics for 24 hours AND fever-free
4. Wash hands frequently to prevent spread
5. Do not share drinking glasses or eating utensils
6. Supportive measures: rest, fluids, soft foods, salt water gargles

Warning Signs to Seek Care:
- Difficulty breathing or swallowing
- Inability to swallow saliva (drooling)
- Muffled or "hot potato" voice
- Neck stiffness or severe neck swelling
- High fever not responding to medications
- No improvement after 48-72 hours of antibiotics
- Worsening symptoms after initial improvement
