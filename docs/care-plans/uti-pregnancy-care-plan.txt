[OVERVIEW]
Urinary tract infections affect approximately 8% of pregnant patients. Up to 10% have
asymptomatic bacteriuria (ASB), which if untreated progresses to symptomatic infection
in 20-40% of cases, including pyelonephritis. UTIs in pregnancy are associated with
serious complications including preterm labor, low birth weight, and maternal sepsis.
Universal screening and prompt treatment significantly reduce these risks.

[SYMPTOMS]
Asymptomatic Bacteriuria (ASB):
- No urinary symptoms
- Diagnosed by screening culture only
- >= 100,000 CFU/mL of single uropathogen

Acute Cystitis (Lower UTI):
- Dysuria (burning with urination)
- Urinary frequency and urgency
- Suprapubic discomfort
- Hematuria (sometimes)
- No fever or flank pain
- Patient appears well

Acute Pyelonephritis (Upper UTI) - MEDICAL EMERGENCY:
- Fever >= 38C (100.4F)
- Chills and rigors
- Flank pain (costovertebral angle tenderness)
- Nausea and vomiting
- May have lower UTI symptoms
- Patient appears ill, may have tachycardia

[DIAGNOSIS]
Screening:
- Urine culture for ALL pregnant patients at 12-16 weeks or first visit
- Positive screen: >= 100,000 CFU/mL single uropathogen
- GBS bacteriuria: >= 10,000 CFU/mL requires treatment

Symptomatic Evaluation:
- Urinalysis with microscopy (leukocyte esterase, nitrites, pyuria, bacteriuria)
- Urine culture before starting antibiotics (do not delay treatment)
- Blood cultures for pyelonephritis
- Consider renal ultrasound if fever persists > 48-72 hours

Culture Interpretation:
- ASB/Cystitis: >= 100,000 CFU/mL
- Symptomatic with lower counts: >= 100 CFU/mL may be significant
- Mixed flora: likely contamination, repeat if symptomatic

[TREATMENT]
ANTIBIOTIC SELECTION BY TRIMESTER:

First Trimester (0-13 weeks):
- Preferred: Cephalexin, Amoxicillin-Clavulanate
- Acceptable: Nitrofurantoin (if no alternative), Fosfomycin
- AVOID: TMP-SMX (folate antagonist), Fluoroquinolones, Tetracyclines

Second Trimester (14-27 weeks):
- Preferred: Nitrofurantoin, Cephalexin, Amoxicillin-Clavulanate
- Acceptable: TMP-SMX (if needed), Fosfomycin
- AVOID: Fluoroquinolones, Tetracyclines

Third Trimester (28+ weeks):
- Preferred: Cephalexin, Amoxicillin-Clavulanate
- Acceptable: Nitrofurantoin (until 36-37 weeks)
- AVOID: Nitrofurantoin >= 38 weeks, TMP-SMX near term, Fluoroquinolones

ASYMPTOMATIC BACTERIURIA:
- Treat with 5-7 day course of appropriate antibiotic
- Test-of-cure culture 1-2 weeks after treatment
- If persistent: different antibiotic for 10-14 days

ACUTE CYSTITIS:
- Empiric therapy: Nitrofurantoin or Cephalexin
- Duration: 5-7 days (7 days preferred in pregnancy)
- Symptoms should improve within 48-72 hours
- Test-of-cure culture 1-2 weeks after treatment

ACUTE PYELONEPHRITIS:
- ADMIT to hospital
- IV fluids (avoid overload - risk of pulmonary edema)
- IV antibiotics: Ceftriaxone 1g q24h (first-line)
- Alternatives: Aztreonam, Ampicillin + Gentamicin
- Continue IV until afebrile 24-48 hours
- Transition to oral antibiotics
- Total duration: 10-14 days
- Begin suppressive prophylaxis after treatment
- If fever persists > 48-72 hours: renal ultrasound, broaden coverage

RECURRENT UTI PROPHYLAXIS:
Indications:
- >= 2 symptomatic UTIs in pregnancy
- >= 3 episodes of bacteriuria
- After one episode of pyelonephritis

Regimens:
- Nitrofurantoin 100 mg PO qHS (avoid near term)
- Cephalexin 250-500 mg PO qHS
Continue until delivery

[FOLLOW_UP]
- Test-of-cure culture 1-2 weeks after ALL UTI treatment
- Monthly or periodic cultures if on prophylaxis
- Communicate GBS bacteriuria to labor team for intrapartum prophylaxis
- Postpartum: discontinue prophylaxis, reassess if symptoms persist

[PATIENT_EDUCATION]
- Complete full course of antibiotics even if symptoms resolve
- Stay well hydrated
- Void frequently and after intercourse
- Recognize symptoms requiring urgent evaluation (fever, flank pain)
- Importance of follow-up cultures to confirm cure
- Safe medications for pregnancy were chosen
